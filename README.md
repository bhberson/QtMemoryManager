CIS 452 Program 3, Memory Manager

"This programming assignment is designed primarily to improve your understanding of memory allocation protocols, operating system kernel data structures, and memory management hardware.  It also incorporates an additional element of modern operating systems: user-interface design and graphical display.
The project may be written in your language of choice; it is primarily a design exercise.  You may use any graphical or display library you choose.  Suggested (and obvious) combinations are C/GTK+, C++/Qt, Perl/Tk, Java/Swing, Python/TkInter, php/html, etc; the decision is yours."
